# Grim Disabler Meteor
This is simple, it is a module to disable any AC Grim check using the Trident Spam in hand.

### How to use:  
- Download the .jar of the releases
- If you don't trust the code, you can download a de-obfuscator, read it and verify. The 5cm versions have compiled/corrupted files so as not to read possible backdoors/rats.

### How Compile:
- Open your favorite editor and graw build the repository
